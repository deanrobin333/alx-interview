### [0. 0x00. Pascal's Triangle](./0x00-pascal_triangle)
- To successfully complete this project, you should revise the following Python concepts:

1.  **Lists and List Comprehensions**:

    - Understand how to create, access, modify, and iterate over lists.
    - Utilize list comprehensions for more concise and readable code, especially for generating rows of Pascal’s Triangle.
2.  **Functions**:

    - Know how to define and call functions.
    - Pass parameters and return values, particularly how to return a list of lists representing Pascal’s Triangle.
3.  **Loops**:

    - Use `for` and `while` loops to iterate through sequences.
    - Nested loops may be necessary for generating each row and calculating the values of Pascal’s Triangle.
4.  **Conditional Statements**:

    - Apply `if`, `elif`, and `else` conditions to implement logic based on the position within Pascal’s Triangle (e.g., the edges of the triangle always being 1).
5.  **Recursion (Optional)**:

    - While not strictly necessary, understanding recursion can provide an alternative approach to generating Pascal’s Triangle.
    - Recognize base cases and recursive cases for a function that generates the triangle’s rows.
6.  **Arithmetic Operations**:

    - Perform addition, a fundamental operation for calculating each element of Pascal’s Triangle as the sum of the two elements directly above it.
7.  **Indexing and Slicing**:

    - Access elements and slices of lists, crucial for identifying and summing the correct elements when constructing each row of the triangle.
8.  **Memory Management**:

    - Be mindful of how lists are stored and copied, especially when creating new rows based on the values of the previous row.
9.  **Error and Exception Handling (Optional)**:

    - Use try-except blocks as needed to handle potential errors, such as invalid input types or values.
10. **Efficiency and Optimization**:

    - Consider the time and space complexity of different approaches to generating Pascal’s Triangle.
    - Evaluate and apply optimizations to improve the performance of the solution.
