### [0. 0x00. Pascal's Triangle](./0x00-pascal_triangle)
- To successfully complete this project, you should revise the following Python concepts:

1.  **Lists and List Comprehensions**:

    - Understand how to create, access, modify, and iterate over lists.
    - Utilize list comprehensions for more concise and readable code, especially for generating rows of Pascal’s Triangle.
2.  **Functions**:

    - Know how to define and call functions.
    - Pass parameters and return values, particularly how to return a list of lists representing Pascal’s Triangle.
3.  **Loops**:

    - Use `for` and `while` loops to iterate through sequences.
    - Nested loops may be necessary for generating each row and calculating the values of Pascal’s Triangle.
4.  **Conditional Statements**:

    - Apply `if`, `elif`, and `else` conditions to implement logic based on the position within Pascal’s Triangle (e.g., the edges of the triangle always being 1).
5.  **Recursion (Optional)**:

    - While not strictly necessary, understanding recursion can provide an alternative approach to generating Pascal’s Triangle.
    - Recognize base cases and recursive cases for a function that generates the triangle’s rows.
6.  **Arithmetic Operations**:

    - Perform addition, a fundamental operation for calculating each element of Pascal’s Triangle as the sum of the two elements directly above it.
7.  **Indexing and Slicing**:

    - Access elements and slices of lists, crucial for identifying and summing the correct elements when constructing each row of the triangle.
8.  **Memory Management**:

    - Be mindful of how lists are stored and copied, especially when creating new rows based on the values of the previous row.
9.  **Error and Exception Handling (Optional)**:

    - Use try-except blocks as needed to handle potential errors, such as invalid input types or values.
10. **Efficiency and Optimization**:

    - Consider the time and space complexity of different approaches to generating Pascal’s Triangle.
    - Evaluate and apply optimizations to improve the performance of the solution.

### [1. 0x01. Lockboxes](./0x01-lockboxes)
### Concepts Needed:

1.  **Lists and List Manipulation**:
    
    - Understanding how to work with lists, including accessing elements, iterating over lists, and modifying lists dynamically.
    - [Python Lists (Python Official Documentation)](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html "Python Lists (Python Official Documentation)")
2.  **Graph Theory Basics**:
    
    - Although not explicitly required, knowledge of graph theory (especially concepts related to traversal algorithms like Depth-First Search or Breadth-First Search) can be very helpful in solving this problem, as the boxes and keys can be thought of as nodes and edges in a graph.
    - [Graph Theory (Khan Academy)](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/algorithms/graph-representation/a/representing-graphs "Graph Theory (Khan Academy)")
3.  **Algorithmic Complexity**:
    
    - Understanding the time and space complexity of your solution is important, as it can help in writing more efficient algorithms.
    - [Big O Notation (GeeksforGeeks)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/asymptotic-notation-and-analysis-based-on-input-size-of-algorithms/ "Big O Notation (GeeksforGeeks)")
4.  **Recursion**:
    
    - Some solutions might require a recursive approach to traverse through the boxes and keys.
    - [Recursion in Python (Real Python)](https://realpython.com/python-recursion/ "Recursion in Python (Real Python)")
5.  **Queue and Stack**:
    
    - Knowing how to use queues and stacks is crucial if implementing a breadth-first search (BFS) or depth-first search (DFS) algorithm to traverse through the keys and boxes.
    - [Python Queue and Stack (GeeksforGeeks)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/queue-in-python/ "Python Queue and Stack (GeeksforGeeks)")
6.  **Set Operations**:
    
    - Understanding how to use sets for keeping track of visited boxes and available keys can optimize the search process.
    - [Python Sets (Python Official Documentation)](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#sets "Python Sets (Python Official Documentation)")
